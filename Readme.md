<h1> Smart Lighting System </h1>

In this we used pir sensors to detect motion.<br>
This model uses 2 pir sensors so that the direction of motion.<br>
Using these 2 Sensors we can establish whether the persons entered aur left. and using this the count of persons in room can be determined<br>
And if the number of persons is more that 0 the light is switched on<br>
<br>
The data is sent to blynk servers<br>
You just need to update the auth with the blynk key
